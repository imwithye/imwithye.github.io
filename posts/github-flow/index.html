This model served us well, facilitating a structured approach to feature development, release management, and hotfixes. However, with the introduction of GitHub and its powerful pull request (PR) workflow, we decided to transition to a more integrated system. This blog post outlines our journey, the challenges we faced, and the solutions we implemented to streamline our development process.\nThe GitFlow Model Under the GitFlow model, our development process was as follows:\nFeature Development: All features were checked out from the staging branch. Merging: Features were merged back into staging. Release: When ready to release, staging was merged into main, triggering a production deployment. Hotfixes: If a bug was found in main, a hotfix branch was created from main, fixed, and then merged back into both staging and main. This workflow ensured stability and control, as any code merged into main was deemed ready for production. However, with the shift to using GitHub, we sought to leverage its PR and code review capabilities to enhance our process further.\nTransition to GitHub PR Workflow With GitHub, we restructured our workflow to utilize PRs more effectively:\nDevelopment Branch: We set main as our development branch. Feature Branches: Features were checked out from main and developed. PRs to Main: Developers created PRs to merge features back into main. Automatic Deployment: Upon PR approval, main automatically deployed to staging. Tagging for Production: Once a tag was created on main, it triggered an automatic deployment to production. This new workflow integrated GitHub’s PR and code review features seamlessly. However, it introduced a significant challenge: handling hotfixes. Since main was now our development branch, any hotfix merged into main could inadvertently include unstable code, potentially affecting production.\nRefining the Workflow To address this issue, we made further modifications to our model while retaining the benefits of GitHub PRs:\nBranch Structure: We retained both main and staging branches. PR to Staging: All developers were required to PR their changes to staging. Releases: When ready to release, a PR from staging to main was created. Hotfixes: In case of a hotfix, the fix was branched from main, PR’d to both main and staging. Although effective, this approach necessitated creating two PRs for each hotfix – one to main and one to staging. To simplify this process, we leveraged GitHub Actions to automate the synchronization of hotfixes across branches.\nAutomation with GitHub Actions We created a GitHub Action using a bot account to automate our hotfix workflow:\nHotfix PR: When a hotfix PR to main is accepted, the action checks out main to a patch branch. Automatic PR: The patch branch automatically creates a PR to staging. Conflict Resolution: In case of conflicts, the bot’s PR allows manual conflict resolution on the patch branch before updating the PR to staging. This automation ensures that our hotfixes are focused on main, with staging being automatically updated via a synchronized patch branch. This approach maintains the integrity of our branches and simplifies the workflow for our developers.\nGitHub Action Script Below is the GitHub Action script we used to implement this workflow:\nname: Pull Main on: push: branches: - main jobs: merge: if: github.event.pull_request == null || github.event.pull_request.head.ref != 'staging' runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: recursive token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }} - name: Push a new branch id: push_branch run: | git config --global user.name \"${{ vars.INFR_AI_BOT_NAME }}\" git config --global user.email \"${{ vars.INFR_AI_BOT_EMAIL }}\" echo \"branch_name=pull-main-$GITHUB_SHA\" \u003e\u003e \"$GITHUB_OUTPUT\" git checkout -b pull-main-$GITHUB_SHA git push origin pull-main-$GITHUB_SHA - uses: actions/github-script@v7 env: WORKING_BRANCH: ${{ steps.push_branch.outputs.branch_name }} with: github-token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }} script: | github.rest.pulls.create({ owner: context.repo.owner, repo: context.repo.repo, title: 'chore: pull main branch into staging', head: process.env.WORKING_BRANCH, base: 'staging', body: 'Automatically generated pull request to merge changes from the main branch into the staging branch.' }) Conclusion By transitioning from GitFlow to GitHub’s PR workflow, we enhanced our development process, integrating modern code review practices. The automation with GitHub Actions further streamlined our workflow, allowing us to maintain stability and control across our branches. This journey underscores the importance of continually evolving our processes to leverage new tools and technologies effectively.\n","wordCount":"708","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-07-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yiwei Gong"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://yiwei.dev/posts/github-flow/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"禅心剑气相思骨","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://yiwei.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://yiwei.dev/ accesskey=h title="禅心剑气相思骨 (Alt + H)">禅心剑气相思骨</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://yiwei.dev/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yiwei.dev/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yiwei.dev/archives title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://yiwei.dev/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Transitioning from GitFlow to GitHub PR Workflow: A Journey in Streamlining Our Development Process</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-07-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 2, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Yiwei Gong</div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=transitioning-from-gitflow-to-github-pr-workflow-a-journey-in-streamlining-our-development-process>Transitioning from GitFlow to GitHub PR Workflow: A Journey in Streamlining Our Development Process<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#transitioning-from-gitflow-to-github-pr-workflow-a-journey-in-streamlining-our-development-process>#</a></h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In our company, we originally adopted the GitFlow model for our development workflow.
